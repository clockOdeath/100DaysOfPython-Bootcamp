# height = 1.65
# weight = 84
# Calculate the bmi using weight and height.
# bmi = weight/height**2
# or
# bmi = 84 / 1.65 ** 2
# print(bmi)
# print(int(bmi))     #Flooring a No. - last whole no.
# print(round(bmi))   #Rounding a No. rounding to nearest whole no.
# print(round(bmi, 3)) #Rounding with the selected decimal nos.

# f-strings type f before "" eg - f"" and can add any data type inside curly brackets {}
# age = 39
